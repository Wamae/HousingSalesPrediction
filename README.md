# Housing Sale Prediction

## Description

This project is an analysis of house sale data in Ames IOWA from 1872 - 2010.
It explores the features using CRISP-DM. In the modelling process, we used the following models:

- [Linear Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html)
- [Ridge Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Ridge.html)
- [KNeighborsRegressor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor.html#sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor)
- [CatBoostRegressor](https://catboost.ai/en/docs/concepts/python-reference_catboostregressor)
- [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
